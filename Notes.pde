/*****************************************************
 * AIR MASH-UP APPLICATION NOTES
 * 
 * Planned Updates
 * - create a flag that identifies when a hand is added or removed from the sensor
 * - create a flag that identifies when a hand changes direction from going up to down, or down to up
 * - add a second sensor to the sensor array
 *
 * Physical Ideas
 * - add a laser to identify where the sensors are pointed
 * - add an led that turns on when it senses a hand is sensed (and turns off when it leaves the sensor)
